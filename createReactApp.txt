CREATE REACT APP

Create React App is a simple Command Line (AKA Terminal) command to run which sets up everything we need to start creating a React Web App

The command to run is...

npx create-react-app app-name

NOTE: The command will create a folder with all the React features inside it. This folder will be created inside of the folder that the command is run inside of. Also, what is put after the "create-react-app" (In this example "app-name") will be the name of the created folder. Finally, it is common practice to use all lowercase letters separated by hyphens (Example: my-app).

Files in a create-react-app App...

The "src" folder is where components are located. Each file should contain a single component with the same name as the file.

Commands to start/compile the React App after it has been created...

cd app-name
npm start

To stop the React App that is running in Terminal, press the following keys...

Control + C
